If you just want a basic web app, the only dependency you strictly need is:

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
</dependency>

Includes:
Spring MVC (spring-web, spring-webmvc)
Embedded Tomcat server (default)
Jackson JSON library for REST APIs

spring-web vs spring-webmvc

Module	Description
spring-web	    Provides core web functionality (REST, HTTP, Client, Multipart support, etc.)
spring-webmvc	  Full MVC framework (DispatcherServlet, Controllers, ViewResolvers, HandlerMapping, etc.)

What spring-web provides >
Basic web-related classes:
RestTemplate / WebClient for REST calls
HttpServletRequest / HttpServletResponse integration
Exception handling for HTTP
Supports REST APIs even without MVC features.

What spring-webmvc provides >
The full MVC stack:
DispatcherServlet → central front controller
Controller annotations → @Controller, @RestController
HandlerMapping → map requests to controllers
ViewResolver → resolve views (Thymeleaf, JSP)
Interceptors, Formatters, Validators
Essentially, it gives you the Model-View-Controller pipeline for handling HTTP requests.

Simple Web Application
Accepting Request/ Giving Response >>>

Suppose we are calling a page -> localhost:8080/home
Request will home to the controller class as we are using @RequestMapping("home")
and the method return String -> "home.jsp"

@Controller
public class HomeController{

    public String home()
    {
        sout("Hi");
        return "home.jsp";
    }

}

SpringBoot has auto configuration and scans the project constantly and knows that all the pages should be under
main > webapp (unless we are explictly changing the path of pages, we can mention in that case)

Still it won't return the page, for that we need a dependency -> tomcat jasper.
Now Spring boot knows how to convert jsp into servlet

You expect visiting http://localhost:8080/home to render home.jsp.
Pages are under src/main/webapp (default for JSP).
Spring Boot auto-configuration scans controllers, knows to use JSPs.
But it doesn’t work by default unless you add Tomcat Jasper dependency.
Why Spring Boot doesn’t render JSPs by default>

  Spring Boot uses an embedded Tomcat server.
  Embedded Tomcat does not include JSP compiler (Jasper) by default.
  JSPs are compiled into servlets at runtime by Jasper.
  Without Jasper:
  Tomcat cannot convert JSP into servlet
  You get an error like:
  HTTP Status 500 – Internal Server Error
  JSP file could not be compiled

Browser
   |
   v
HTTP Request /home
   |
   v
DispatcherServlet (Spring MVC)
   |
   v
HomeController.home()  --> prints "Controller method called!"
   |
   v
Return "home" (logical view)
   |
   v
ViewResolver --> /WEB-INF/views/home.jsp
   |
   v
Tomcat Jasper compiles JSP -> Servlet
   |
   v
Servlet executed -> HTML generated
   |
   v
Response sent to Browser

Servlet Container >
A servlet container (like Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow) is a part of a web server that:
Receives HTTP requests.
Manages servlets (Java classes that implement HttpServlet).
Handles the lifecycle of servlets (init, service, destroy).
Sends HTTP responses back to the client (browser).
Key point: The container only knows how to run servlets, not raw JSP files.

JSP is Not Directly Executable
A JSP file looks like HTML with embedded Java code:
<h1>Welcome, <%= userName %>!</h1>

The servlet container cannot execute this directly because it’s not a Java class.
This is where Tomcat Jasper (JSP engine) comes in:
Converts JSP → Java servlet class
Compiles servlet → .class file
Servlet is loaded and executed by the servlet container

Servlet executed by container -> HTML generated
        |
        v
HTTP Response sent back to browser

JSP → Servlet conversion is required because containers only execute servlets.
Jasper does this compilation.
Once compiled, the servlet is executed like any other Java class, generating HTML dynamically.
